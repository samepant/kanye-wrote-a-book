<h1> Kanye Komputer writes a book </h1>

<p>Well, more of a book of kanye-isms. Can a kanye chatbot gone writer shed light on the mysteries of the Kanye-verse?</p>

<p> Attempting to contribute to the NaNoGenMo party.</p>

<h2>Built on:</h2>
<a href="https://www.npmjs.org/package/markov">Substack's markov chatbot module.</a>

<h2>Files:</h2>
<p>kanye.txt - the file containing a bunch of text from Kanye's various interviews.</p>
<p>kanye-lyrics.txt - a selection of lyrics (didn't end up using).</p>
<p>kanye-isms.txt - generated kanye-isms. about 59,000 words.</p>
<p>kanye-novel.js - this does the creation of the actual kanye-ism novel file.</p>
<p>there are a bunch of other files (mostly unfinished experiements).</p>
<p>the kanye-site file will have the web presentation version once its done.</p>
