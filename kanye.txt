I just close my eyes and act like I'm a 3-year-old
I try to get as close to a childlike level as possible because we were all artists back then
so you just close your eyes and think back to when you were as young as you can remember and had the least barriers to your creativity
I think I started to approach time in a different way after the accident
before I was more willing to give my time to people and things that I wasn't as interested in because somehow I allowed myself to be brainwashed into being forced to work with other people or on other projects that I had no interest in

so simply the accident gave me the opportunity to do what I really wanted to do
I was a music producer and everyone was telling me that I had no business becoming a rapper so it gave me the opportunity to tell everyone hey I need some time to recover
but during that recovery period I just spent all my time honing my craft and making the college dropout

without that period there would have been so many phone calls and so many people putting pressure on me from every direction—so many people I somehow owed something to—and I would have never had the time to do what I wanted to
yes

It gave me perspective on life—that it was really now or 100 percent never

I think that people don't make the most of their lives

so you know for me right now it seems like it's the beginning of me rattling the cage of making some people nervous

and people are strategically trying to do things to mute my voice in some way or make me look like I'm a lunatic or pinpoint the inaccuracies in my grammar to somehow take away from the overall message of what I'm saying
as my grandfather would say life is a performance
I'm giving all that I have in this life

I'm opening up my notebook and I'm saying everything in there out loud

a lot of people are very sacred with their ideas and there is something to protecting yourself in that way but there's also something to idea sharing or being the person who makes the mistake in public so people can study that
well all we have is today

you know the past is gone and tomorrow is not promised
yeah! so I just had to throw it all in the trash

I had to not follow any of the rules because there was no way to match up to the previous album

dark fantasy was the first time you heard that collection of sonic paintings in that way

so I had to completely destroy the landscape and start with a new story

dark fantasy was the fifth installment of a collection that included the four albums before it
It's kind of the Luke I am your father moment

Yeezus though was the beginning of me as a new kind of artist

stepping forward with what I know about architecture about classicism about society about texture about synesthesia—the ability to see sound—and the way everything is everything and all these things combine and then starting from scratch with Yeezus

that's one of the reasons why I didn't want to use the same formula of starting the album with a track like blood on the leaves and having that Nina Simone sample up front that would bring everyone in using postmodern creativity where you kind of lean on something that people are familiar with and comfortable with to get their attention

I actually think the most uncomfortable sound on Yeezus is the sound that the album starts with which is the new version of what would have been called radio static

It's the sonic version of what internet static would be—that's how I would describe that opening
It's Daft Punk sound

It was just like that moment of being in a restaurant and ripping the tablecloth out from under all the glasses

that's what on sight does sonically
It's the only way that I can survive

the risk for me would be in not taking one—that's the only thing that's really risky for me

I live inside and I've learned how to swim through backlash or maintain through the current of a negative public opinion and create from that and come through it and spring forth to completely surprise everyone—to satisfy all believers and annihilate all doubters

and at this point it's just fun
It's funny that you would say mentally physically spiritually because my answer before you even said that was going to be god sex and alcohol
well I don't have an addictive personality so that means that I can lean on what might be someone else's vice just enough to make it through to the next day

you know just enough religion a half-cup of alcohol with some ice in it and a nice chaser and then
yeah—a lot of sex

and then I'd make it to the next week
I've heard people say stuff about how a work is just taken out of your hands

I remember that we were shooting the new slaves video before I'd even finished the second verse

we were on our third shoot day and I was in the studio still finishing it because my lyrics aren't written beforehand

It's very important to me that they're completely in sync with what's happening in society at that time—that they're very timeless but very up to date
I don't use a lot of current-affairs names—I've used them seldomly—but I feel like it's just a current itself a wave that I'm surfing
there is no sport without the wave so I have to wait for it
If the waves are high then we're gonna have a fun day
If the waves are low then you just stay on the beach
well I'm a trained fine artist
I went to art school from the time I was 5 years old
I was like a prodigy out of Chicago
I'd been in national competitions from the age of 14
I got three scholarships to art schools—to st
Xavier to the American Academy of Art and to the Art Institute of Chicago—and I went to the American Academy of Art
so the joke that I've actually played on everyone is that the entire time I've actually just been a fine artist
I just make sonic paintings and these sonic paintings have led me to become whatever people think of when you say Kanye West
Madonna I think is the greatest visual musical artist that we've ever had
If you look at her photo log the photographers that she was able to work with throughout her career framed her in the proper way
It was the proper context
It was that visual that made sure that everything was gonna cut through in a certain way
I mean you know as much as anyone how important the visuals are
so I like to collaborate with different masters—whether it's George Condo or Nick Knight or Takashi Murakami—on the visuals that are connected to the pieces and just have a simple high school conversation with whoever I'm working with and bring our thoughts together but ultimately what we do is through the lens of that collaborator and it ends up being their final hand
you know you can go to a bunch of people who say hey I want to make a video based off of these white-trash t-shirts
but bound 2 is Nick Knight's take on those white-trash t-shirts and if I went to five other artists they would all do it in other ways
so I think that's part of the beauty of life
It's more about the art of conversation the companionship the friendships and the quality of life that you get out of working—it's about the creative process even more than the final product
I think there's something kind of depressing about a product being final because the only time a product is really final is when you're in a casket
yeah
I think all that stuff around it is just that: controversy
I think people are afraid of dreams and that video is one of the closest things to the way that dreams look and feel or the way joy looks and feels with the colors
you know I think there are rules to fashion with the all-black everything and rules to art with white galleries
there are rules to how a lot of things are: the concrete jungle stone pavement brick walls
there are even rules to what a Brooklyn apartment looks like
but this video completely didn't respect any of those rules whatsoever
laughs It's a dream and I think the controversy comes from the fact that I don't think most people are comfortable with their own dreams so it's hard for them to be comfortable with other people's dreams
I mean look it took some time for us to be comfortable with a walking talking mouse but that became an icon
so this stuff what I'm doing now is the beginning of me throwing out what it means to be a rapper—you know with the gold chain
well I'd be biased to think that the community of geminis is the most consistently in tune with what their spirit is telling them to do or why they have breath in their lungs
but I do think that creative geminis Tupac Biggie Prince Miles Davis all being geminis have throughout history been really in tune with those things
you know some different friends of mine have been showing me these interviews that Tupac did and how they're very simple and to the point
I watched them and one of the things that Tupac kept saying is that he wanted thugs to be recognized
now Jay-Z is a multi-hundred-millionaire who came from the streets so Tupac's mission in a way has been realized
but my mission is very different from Tupac's—and I'm not Tupac
but I think that when I compare myself to Steve Jobs Walt Disney Howard Hughes or whoever it's because I'm trying to give people a little bit of context to the possibilities that are in front of me as opposed to putting me in the rap category that the Grammys has put me in
In no way do I want to be the next any one of them
but I am the first me
so I only mention those other names to try to give people a little bit of context
you know
there's only one person
yeah
he got last summer
and I'd never given it up till last summer
now he's thinking about taking it back
It's a real question for me
do I want to?
that wasn't my goal
my goal is just to be respected as a man when I walk down the street with my family
I don't care what your job is you're not gonna talk down to me you're not gonna try to get a rise out of me
I'm a man first
and in establishing that some interesting things have happened
It's difficult
and then put on top of that the idea of going and taking meetings with people and people say we don't want to work with you because we saw you get mad about running into the sign
but also there's no fangs
I don't have fangs
I'm a porcupine
I'm a blowfish
like I'm a—what's the fish that blows up?
yeah
I'm a blowfish
I'm not a shark I'm a blowfish
so that perfect example about me hitting my head it's like a blowfish
I wasn't coming out of my house going to a paparazzi's house to attack them
I'm defending my family in front of my own house
I'm defending my name as someone's screaming something negative at me
that's a blowfish
people have me pinned as a shark or a predator in some way and in no way am I that
I wouldn't want to hurt anyone
I want to defend people
I want to help people
for the person that wrote that were they involved with anything last year that was as culturally significant as the Yeezus tour or that album? they didn't even talk there about the photographs or the dress or Andrea Bocelli singing or the marble tables
they're like: It's a gold toilet
no
the bathrooms—that usually would be a porta-potty—were wrapped in a fabric that was neutral to match the fort
the bar was terrible and the wedding planner didn't approve it with me
I was having issues with this wedding planner the entire time on approvals and I get there and they threw some weird plastic bar there
so the same materials that were used to cover the bathroom we said let's just use that because this is all we have to make the bar look better
which it did in the end
and anyone knows that you cannot pick up tools yourself because of—what are those rules about the workers?
yeah unions
you can't do that
It's illegal
that's false
and what I talked about in it was the idea of celebrity and celebrities being treated like blacks were in the '60s having no rights and the fact that people can slander your name
I said that in the toast
and I had to say this in a position where I from the art world am marrying Kim
and how we're going to fight to raise the respect level for celebrities so that my daughter can live a more normal life
she didn't choose to be a celebrity
but she is
so I'm going to fight to make sure she has a better life
my feelings don't matter anymore
no
one of the things that I said at the speech was anyone that's at this table has had to defend me or Kim or both of us at some point in their life
ask a boxer: In the third round when he hit you from the side on your ear how did that specifically feel? you wouldn't ask a boxer that
because you know they're there to fight
meaning now you know I'm here to fight
I'm here to fight for the re-education of what celebrity is
to say yes we are celebrities but yes we're also innovators we're also inventors we're also thoughtful
that's fine
but that's not the case is it?
yeah
I'm sitting right here it's a fight
I'm fighting with the way I line my words up together and the way I place a sweater on top of a t-shirt
at this point people know what's up
people know I'm smart
and people know that whether it's SNL or Jimmy Kimmel it's a trend to take the piss out of celebrity—just as much of a trend as wearing a gray hoodie or driving a Prius
In the speech I talked about the idea of collaboration and all the people involved working together and being able to change things
meaning there was a time for two or three years where fashion designers wouldn't give Kim dresses
there was a time they wouldn't even let me be at shows
now the idea that Kim is in a Givenchy Couture dress is raising the communication
because people would be more apt to be like celebrities don't really have style
celebrities can't dress
celebrities are less educated
but they haven't had the chance to be able to break through and have Carine Roitfeld sitting right there
Carine Roitfeld is the walt Disney of what Tumblr is today
she is the Kanye west of what Tumblr is today
she's the single most important person to what street style is today
and she was at the wedding seven seats down from Kim who is one of the number one fashion plates of today
so I said wow Carine is seven seats down from Kim
Farnaz Farjam the producer of the Kardashians and the producer of the real world is four seats down from director Steve McQueen
and four seats because in between them is Hosain Rahman from Jawbone
this is what I talked about
that was not a forty-five-minute speech to myself
do you realize what that means for those people to be in that close of a proximity to each other?
all that I wouldn't even speak on
It doesn't even matter to me whatsoever who would show up
because the most important person to show up there to me was Kim
and that's all that matters to me
I had to fight for that for seven years
but the fact that these other people showed up that are from such different worlds but have done such dynamic things—they're all in a way equal to what Kim has done in TV or what I had done in music
I was so moved that I just wanted people to stop and think they weren't sitting at a table full of fashion people they weren't sitting at a table full of celebrities they weren't sitting at a table full of movie directors
It really was a representation of the way we receive information today post-Internet
and so page six can't overshadow the main point: Carine Roitfeld was sitting next to Kim Kardashian
that alone to me is like the same moment when I brought Mos Def to the studio with Jay-Z
It's about the people and the fact that they're from different walks of life and that they're working together and not discriminating against each other
there was a class system and now there's a creative class system and I think that's what you were talking about a bit—the class system of creativity
and my point is they were all at her wedding
but when an Instagram photo gets 23 million likes
that's because of who
don't say you don't know! It's because of Kim
meaning there's no photo that I would have put up by myself or next to one of my smarty friends that would have got that amount of likes
so now you take this photo that has that amount of likes and it has a flower wall from the same guy who does the lanvin shows and it has a couture Givenchy dress and Givenchy tuxedo in it
that's the point
now the thing that is the most popular is also communicating the highest level of creativity
the concept of Kimye has more cultural significance than what page six could write
saying hey I like Kim isn't as inspiring to people as us getting married
and anyone that's in a relationship knows that in order to get to the point to get married and then to be married and to then carry on it needs that work put into it
right now people look at it and it's like wow that's inspiring
meaning that love is infectious
you know God is infectious God flowing through us and us being little baby creators and shit
but his energy and his love and what he wants us to have as people and the way he wants us to love each other that is infectious
like they said in step brothers: never lose your dinosaur
this is the ultimate example of a person never losing his dinosaur
meaning that even as I grew in cultural awareness and respect and was put higher in the class system in some way for being this musician I never lost my dinosaur
Kim is this girl who fucking turns me on
I love her
this is who I want to be next to and be around
and then people would try to say well you know if you're a musician you should be with a musician and if you want to design you need to be with a girl from the design world
I don't give a fuck about people's opinions
because when a kid falls in love with an airplane or a bike or a dinosaur—especially if you're an only child and it's not because of the book that the sibling was reading—it's like fuck you mean to tell me that the dinosaurs walked the earth and stuff like that?!
that's amazing!
you mean to tell me that these giant multi-ton crafts can fly that fast and that loud and they can flip and there's danger the possibility of them exploding?
that's fucking cool!
you mean to tell me that this girl with this fucking body and this face is also into style and she's a nice person and she has her own money and is family-oriented?
that's just as cool as a fucking fighter jet or dinosaur!
and just as rarely seen
I feel like you're stronger as a team
because when you know you have a team player it's not one on the world anymore
at least it's two on the world
yeah and then two and a half eventually
It's like having some eyes in the back of your head
that's one reason why when people try to spoof or talk shit it's like: but you're mad because basically Kim is the type of girl that her entire life if you were in school with her most people would be studying and up late nights but for some reason she would have the skill set to go and grab the one book turn to the exact page and just magically say that's the exact answer
or she could wink at the person who had done all the work and get it done anyway
and the point of life is getting shit done and being happy
and the joke was that I was supposed to say on the song come on Jay you know we're both gonna have daughters
and I'm so mad because you know when I pop that creative-genius shit?
If I had had that that could've been my one moment where I'm like: okay fuck all the conversation
look at that
I called that one
I think Yeezus is the beginning of a completely new era of music
It was all new rules
It just broke every rule possible
none of the ideas were popular ideas
even bound 2 when the video came out I think people's apprehension—I mean it's the same as any other Kanye West video
you just have colorful bears running around
It was completely morphed and weird and psychedelic and really druggy
I would have just liked to have had more nudity in it
that's the only thing
I just want to do crazy colorful shit like that that has more nudity
It's funny because when the Clippers situation happened people started bringing up that song again
sometimes you do things in the same way that a designer might throw out a new cut or a rapper might throw out a new concept and people might not be into it at that time
If new slaves had come out right after the Clippers incident it would have seemed more timely
so the thirty meetings that I was having where I was going through a lot of these stay in your place type conversations—stay in your box this is what you do you can't do anything else—that led me to the point of creating new slaves and blood on the leaves and the entire Yeezus album and to make the album basically like a protest in music where it only has like four melodies on it—you know other people weren't in that place
obviously certain things are more digestible for mass consumption
but it was interesting
that song that I do feel is the best rap verse of all
time—
new slaves
the second verse
I argue that it's the best rap verse of all time
It's the coming to America or Anchorman of a verse
you know it's got the funny shit
It's got the antagonization
It's got patterns
It's got social and political consciousness
It's got struggle
It's got bravado
It's everything that a rap verse is supposed to be
yeah! because yeah I rapped them
but I worked on them for like eight months! and the thing is I had to finish the verses in order for the album to come out and it's game time
I didn't freestyle those verses
that shit was worked and processed and Disneyfied and everything
by the way those lines are super scary and serious and everything that I'm saying on Yeezus is super politically direct so I think that it's funny that you said that because I think he needs to clarify that to people—that I didn't make it up in that time
I just said them in that time
It did move the needle
only positive came from it
maybe I'm not as good friends as I could have been with the Saint Laurent designer
and now I don't get the red-and-black versions of the white-and-black pants that are in stores or whatever I would have got as a musician
but other than that that communication was real
alexander Wang made sure that I was able to go to a Balenciaga show and I was never allowed to do that before because I was a celebrity
listen to what I'm saying—me as Kanye West: I guarantee you I'm more than 50 percent responsible for every men's shoe that they sell
me the singular person
more than 50 percent responsible for every Balenciaga shoe they sell
and they would say you can't come to the show because you are a celebrity
but all honesty no ego I have a level of influence and I have a level of respect for the designers
and we move product on that Barneys floor
It sounds exactly like that
I think just my usual pattern is like that
It's like a pendulum
the pendulum gains momentum by swinging in the other direction
even lyrically I think about certain lines that I say on my new single which is called all day that usually Jay would say but Jay's not on there
so I say all day nigga it's Ye nigga
shopping for the winter it's just may nigga
ball so hard man this shit cray nigga
you ain't getting money unless you got eight figures
right?
Jay would have said that
and then eventually I would have came in with like whatever I come in with
but the balance of a meal is that when people walk in they want water first
people definitely weren't getting water first on Yeezus
I do fight with myself to say keep fighting
but also you know you can't win every single fight
It's a long war and if you're out there trying to like blow up every single building you won't win the war
when I was sitting and trying to do a collaboration with the Gap in the meeting when they're like no because you're a celebrity and you have a bad reputation and you don't know anything about clothing so we don't want to do this—in that meeting there's no extra single that I could have done that could have got me that deal
there's no extra Grammy that I could have won that could have made it more real
and that's the reason why I had to express the way I feel
which all rhymed just right there
but Yeezus was extremely purposeful
and what came from Yeezus: paparazzi are nicer to me
the entire fashion industry is nicer to me
I do have a collaboration coming out
young designers that would go and work at a house now look and say wow maybe we could potentially work at Donda
maybe we could work for Kanye
maybe that's a real thing
because designers that are geared up to only want to work at a french fashion house are completely under the perception that it wouldn't be cool to work for a celebrity
man it's crazy
and having to take all of your energy or a lot more of your energy to focus on fashion
and while you're focusing on that such-and-such just keeps coming for the spot
and I might complain about how hard it is in clothing but also I think it's great that it's so hard
because the barrier to entry is really really really really high
and I'm literally trying to do—back when I did watch the throne and the fashion I think it was just too much for people
It was just too crazy
It was just too crazy to do watch the throne niggas in Paris shoot a surround-vision film in Qatar show the film in Cannes…
yeah kilt
then do two fashion shows with Jourdan Dunn Joan Smalls Irina Shayk have Diddy Anna Wintour Riccardo Kim at the show and drop the Yeezys?
It felt like every single industry that I was trying to tap into looked at every other industry and everyone held hands
It was like fuck that
no
this is just too crazy
history's gonna be harder to make than I thought
both me and Kim had to learn how to communicate as a team
these are two LeBrons you know?
meaning she could do shit that a girlfriend in a relationship could never do
obviously
and I could do stuff that a guy in a relationship could never do
so if you look at half my tweets back then they were always like funny tweets that I wouldn't be able to say now
It wouldn't be respectful to my relationship
It's interesting as I'm delving into being married: like what is my verbal creative communication?
that's another thing I really like about clothing and film—you could still communicate with a film because it's not you
but when you're a reality star or a rapper you are the film
yes! It's picking up skill sets that give you longevity
that's what I like about Jay
he has longevity
he's still at the top of relevancy from the way he moves the way he interacts with people his ability to brush things off of his shoulder and just win at life
he's the poster child of winning
and I think I was the poster child of like fighting and winning
but you always saw the fight
and with Jay you always saw the win
that's funny that you're saying that
one of the reasons why I think that me and Kim are very powerful together isn't just the concept of celebrity or this mega rap star and this mega-beautiful pop star
It's something I explain to my girl: she is who she is
I am who I am
we have advisers and friends and everything but those people are who they are and we are who we are
and what I had to learn from Kim is how to take more of her advice and less of other people's advice
there's a lot of Kim K skills that were added
In order to win at life you need some Kim K skills period
It depends
I think the people that are in the positions of power are starting to see or recognize that it's more than a celebrity thing it's more than a music thing and that there is something there
there's people who do celebrity lines
It's what they do
they've signed up to sit at a different table and to be in a different business than the people who do high-end lines
I don't know man
I hope I can get one of these songs out in the next couple of weeks just to have something up and running
but I think most likely September
I go back and forth
like should it be September or should it be October?
should it be November?
when Beyoncé was working on her last album she took a while
I was thinking it could somehow come out in June like Yeezus and just kill it for the summer
but then I'm like I have to work on adidas and be with my child
yeah
this time three years ago here at the Mercer working on niggas in Paris at this time in early June it was apparent it was still not finished
I had the married at the mall line we had that shit cray Jay had his verse… Jay finished his verse
he always finishes and my shit is always kind of open
like okay now I've got the Will Ferrell sample so I need to say something that finishes the verse
but people have to not know what it means
laughs so it's like problem-solving to get to the point where you're saying going gorillas
It's difficult sometimes
but now for the new album one new thing could change everything
I had an idea of the way I wanted to do the album
and then I got a new song that's so good that the album has to be balanced against it
this song is a song that can be in the club like don't like or niggas in Paris
whereas before I was working on the album and I had these beautiful songs they were just more songs
they weren't saying okay tuck your whole summer in
they were just saying hey I'm a great musician I make these beautiful songs and they have all this meaning and nobody can make anything that means this much
well when I work on an album it's fun at certain times
there's some accomplishments and sometimes there's a bit of frustration
and it's usually like a nine-month process right?
this is a multi-lifetime process that we have now embarked on
meaning starting now you're just starting to see a glimmer of what the idea of West will mean
so right now at this age and with this visibility and with the skill sets that Kim is now giving me I think I have a good chance of success in building something that has longevity high integrity high success rate and is very fulfilling not only for me creatively but also in adding fulfillment to people's lives
adding ease
adding wonder
adding magic
well you build your happy wife happy life happy home all this stuff right?
everybody that's in a relationship that has ever worked on a home knows one of the most frustrating processes is actually working on the home
so when people would see me last year two years ago unhappy I was in the process of building the home
but what makes me happy is land and we're on a boat now
this is Christopher Columbus
this is uncharted waters we're on
we'd be super happy to be on land and also a little bit like ah the journey's over! but I feel like we got the Vogue cover Steve McQueen won the Oscar we finally got married… you know?
we have a child
we're a family now
I am an arbiter of taste and people think that I have the ability to make things cool—or if I'm doing it it should be cool
and I feel that this stuff's starting to be cool
and that feels good to me
because I don't like walking around with people thinking I'm doing uncool shit because there's nothing I'm doing that's uncool
It's all innovative
you just might not understand it yet
but it's cool
family is super cool
going home to one girl every night is super cool
Just going home and getting on the floor and playing with your child is super cool
not wearing a red leather jacket and just looking like a dad and shit is like super cool
having someone that I can call Mom again
that shit is super cool
I think you got to make your case
seventh grade I wanted to be on the basketball team
I didn’t get on the team so that summer I practiced
I was on the summer league
my team won the championship; I was the point guard
and then when I went for eighth grade I practiced and I hit every free throw every layup and the next day I looked on this chart and my name wasn’t on it
I asked the coach what’s up and they were like you’re just not on it
I was like but I hit every shot
the next year I was on the junior team when I was a freshman that’s how good I was
but I wasn’t on my eighth-grade team because some coach some Grammy some reviewer some fashion person some blah blah blah they’re all the same as that coach
where I didn’t feel that I had a position in eighth grade to scream and say because I hit every one of my shots I deserve to be on this team! I’m letting it out on everybody who doesn’t want to give me my credit
yeah you put me on the team
so I’m going to use my platform to tell people that they’re not being fair
anytime I’ve had a big thing that’s ever pierced and cut across the Internet it was a fight for justice
justice
and when you say justice it doesn’t have to be war
justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly
It could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that I play
you know if Michael Jordan can scream at the refs me as Kanye West as the Michael Jordan of music can go and say this is wrong
my beautiful dark twisted fantasy and watch the throne: neither was nominated for album of the year and I made both of those in one year
I don’t know if this is statistically right but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age but I haven’t won one against a white person
but the thing is I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate
yeah I don’t want them to rewrite history right in front of us
at least not on my clock
I really appreciate the moments that I was able to win rap album of the year or whatever
but after a while it’s like: wait a second; this isn’t fair
this is a setup
I remember when both Gnarls Barkley and Justin Timberlake lost for album of the year and I looked at Justin and I was like: do you want me to go onstage for you? you know do you want me to fight
for what’s right
I am so credible and so influential and so relevant that I will change things
so when the next little girl that wants to be you know a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world and it’s time for us to roll out and say did this person have the biggest thing of the year? that thing is more fair because I was there
It’s only led me to complete awesomeness at all times
It’s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness
beauty truth awesomeness
that’s all it is
I don’t have one regret
if anyone’s reading this waiting for some type of full-on flat apology for anything they should just stop reading right now
you know what? I can answer that but I’m I’m just not afraid but I know that would be such a distraction
It’s such a strong thing and people have such a strong feeling about it
dark fantasy was my long backhanded apology
you know how people give a backhanded compliment? It was a backhanded apology
It was like all these raps all these sonic acrobatics
I was like: let me show you guys what I can do and please accept me back
you want to have me on your shelves
I don’t have some type of romantic relationship with the public
I’m like the anti-celebrity and my music comes from a place of being anti
that was the album where I gave people what they wanted
I don’t think that at that point with my relationship with the public and with skeptical buyers that I could’ve done black skinhead
It’s always going to be 80 percent at least what I want to give and 20 percent fulfilling a perception
If you walk into an old man’s house they’re not giving nothing
they’re at 100 percent exactly what they want to do
I would hear stories about Steve Jobs and feel like he was at 100 percent exactly what he wanted to do but I’m sure even a Steve Jobs has compromised
even a Rick Owens has compromised
you know even a Kanye West has compromised
sometimes you don’t even know when you’re being compromised till after the fact and that’s what you regret
I don’t want to come off dissing dark fantasy
It’s me never being satisfied and then me coming and admitting and saying the truth
as much as I can air things out for other people to air things out for myself to say I feel like this could’ve been stronger
yeah people asked me to change my name for that album
yeah different people
they said do it under a different name
and when it came out people used to be like man I wish it had more rapping on it
but I think the fact that I can’t sing that well is what makes 808s so special
yeah
I love the fact that I’m bad at things you know what I’m saying? I’m forever the 35-year-old 5-year-old
I’m forever the 5-year-old of something
creative output you know is just pain
I’m going to be cliché for a minute and say that great art comes from pain
but also I’d say a bigger statement than that is: great art comes from great artists
there’s a bunch of people that are hurt that still couldn’t have made the album that was super-polarizing and redefined the sound of radio
there are people who have figured out the exact you know Kanye West formula the mix between graduation and 808s and were able to become more successful at it
stronger was the first like dance-rap song that resonated to that level and then 808s was the first album of that kind you know? It was the first like black new wave album
I didn’t realize I was new wave until this project
thus my connection with the graphic designer Peter Saville with Raf Simons with high-end fashion with minor chords
I hadn’t heard new wave! but I am a black new wave artist
I just dove more into rapping because I had a lot that I wanted to express and I wasn’t a really really good singer
yeah I held on to the last moments of it
I knew when I wrote the line light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson from the song slow Jamz I was going to be a big star
at the time they used to have the virgin music stores and I would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself I’m soaking in these last moments of anonymity
I knew I was going to make it this far
I knew that this was going to happen
I used to have tracks that sounded like Timbaland
I had tracks that sounded like DJ Premier
but Jay-Z was an amazing communicator that made the soul sound extremely popular
and because I could make the soul sound in my sleep it finally gave me a platform to put the message that my parents put inside of me and that Dead Prez helped to get out of me and Mos Def and Talib Kweli they helped to get out of me: I was able to put it sloppily rap it on top of the platform that Jay-Z had created for me
before when I wanted to rap my raps sounded like a bit like Cam’ron; they sounded a bit like Mase; they sounded a bit like Jay-Z or whoever
and it wasn’t until I hung out with Dead Prez and understood how to make you know raps with a message sound cool that I was able to just write all falls down in 15 minutes
yeah that’s how I discovered my style
I was just hanging out with them all the time in New York
I would produce for them
you know I was able to slip past everything with a pink polo but I am Dead Prez
and now because I was able to slip past I have a responsibility at all times
I was trying to do different things with orchestras
It was just a vibe that I was trying to get at a sound I was trying to mix with hip-hop to try to see how far I could expand it
I guess that was a Chicago thing like Quincy Jones
I really liked the sound of some projects that Jon Brion had worked on
I was always considered this crazy hothead kid but I would always just go and just really break bread with someone who I respected
I will completely bow to anybody I respect
yeah
I guess it’s a very pop moment of a lifetime or generation
I mean my dad’s generation is a generation of messaging you know? but that’s just a piece of me being the opinionated individual that I am
yeah it was pretty bugged out
when you think about it I was wearing like a Juicy Couture men’s polo shirt
we weren’t there like ready for war
no it’s just being able to articulate yourself better
all falls down is the same stuff
I mean I am my father’s son
I’m my mother’s child
that’s how I was raised
I am in the lineage of Gil Scott-Heron great activist-type artists
but I’m also in the lineage of a Miles Davis you know that liked nice things also
I’m always the one that’s in a darker mood
and then also there was still a thing where I didn’t feel comfortable you know going out on tour the this the that all that by myself yet
like I needed
I needed to connect with Jay
yeah even with the kilt on
maybe 90 percent of the time it looks like I’m not having a good time
any woman that you’re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of you know energy
It’s actually easier to focus in some ways
yeah that’s what I mean when I say like yo I’m going to be super zenned out like five years from now
I’m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend you know? I’m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus
and that inspires me
that was from a place of love
It’s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways
you know the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore
and it’s not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get
because I just see like an amazing person that I’m in love with that I want to help
yeah because my mother was you know I have family but I was with my mother 80 percent of the time
my mom was basically
that is a really interesting powerful question
one of the things was just to be protective that I would do anything to protect my child or my child’s mother
as simple as that
I don’t want to explain too much into what my thoughts on you know fatherhood are because I’ve not fully developed those thoughts yet
I don’t have a kid yet
yeah
well I just don’t want to talk to America about my family
like this is my baby
this isn’t America’s baby
architecture you know this one Corbusier lamp was like my greatest inspiration
I lived in Paris in this loft space and recorded in my living room and it just had the worst acoustics possible but also the songs had to be super simple because if you turned up some complicated sound and a track with too much bass it’s not going to work in that space
this is earlier this year
I would go to museums and just like the Louvre would have a furniture exhibit and I visited it like five times even privately
and I would go see actual Corbusier homes in real life and just talk about you know why did they design it? they did like the biggest glass panes that had ever been done
like I say I’m a minimalist in a rapper’s body
It’s cool to bring all those vibes and then eventually come back to Rick Rubin because I would always think about Def Jam
for him it’s really just inside of him
I’m still just a kid learning about minimalism and he’s a master of it
It’s just really such a blessing to be able to work with him
I want to say that after working with Rick it humbled me to realize why I hadn’t even though I produced watch the throne; even though I produced dark fantasy why I hadn’t won album of the year yet
this album is moments that I haven’t done before like just my voice and drums
what people call a rant but put it next to just a drumbeat and it cuts to the level of like Run-DMC
or KRS-One
the last record I can remember and I’m going to name records that you’ll think are cheesy but like J-Kwon Tipsy
people would think that’s like a lower-quality less intellectual form of hip-hop but that’s always my no 1
there’s no opera sounds on this new album you know what I mean? It’s just like super low-bit
I’m still like slightly a snob but I completely removed my snob heaven songs; I just removed them altogether
yeah it’s like trap and drill and house
I knew that I wanted to have a deep Chicago influence on this album and I would listen to like old Chicago house
I think that even black skinhead could border on house on sight sounds like acid house and then I Am a God obviously sounds like super house
yeah visceral tribal
I’m just trying to cut away all the you know it’s even like what we talk about with clothing and fashion that sometimes all that gets in the way
you even see the way I dress now is so super straight
yeah kill self
that’s all I have to say
kill self
no I don’t think I feel like that anymore
I feel like I don’t want to be inside anymore
like I uninvited myself
I think just more actual self-realization and self-belief
the longer your longevity is the more confidence you build
the idea of Kanye and vanity are like synonymous
but I’ve put myself in a lot of places where a vain person wouldn’t put themselves in
like what’s vanity about wearing a kilt
but the passion is for humanity
the passion is for people
the passion is for the 18-year-old version of myself
the passion is for the kids at my shows
I need to do more
I need to be able to give people more of what they want that currently is behind a glass
I don’t believe that it’s luxury to go into a store and not be able to afford something
I believe luxury is to be able to go into a store and be able to afford something

I sat down with a clothing guy that I won’t mention but hopefully if he reads this article he knows it’s him and knows that out of respect I didn’t mention his name: this guy he questioned me before I left his office: If you’ve done this this and this why haven’t you gone further in fashion?
and I say I’m learning
but ultimately this guy that was talking to me doesn’t make Christmas presents meaning that nobody was asking for his stuff as a Christmas present
If you don’t make Christmas presents meaning making something that’s so emotionally connected to people don’t talk to me
I’m a professional musician because I have the structure of universal records
I’m a professional creative
since I did the Louis Vuitton sneaker I’ve never been allowed to be in a continually creative structured place that makes product
I’ve had meetings where a guy actually told me what we’re trying to figure out is how we can control you
In the meeting to me!
why do you want to control me?
like I want the world to be better!
all I want is positive!
all I want is dopeness!
why would you want to control that?
that’s why I said I throw these Maybach keys in the new song new slaves
I would rather sit in a factory than sit in a Maybach
I want to tell people I can create more for this world and I’ve hit the glass ceiling
If I don’t scream if I don’t say something then no one’s going to say anything you know?
so I come to them and say dude talk to me!
respect me!
yeah respect my trendsetting abilities
once that happens everyone wins
the world wins; fresh kids win; creatives win; the company wins
I think what Kanye West is going to mean is something similar to what Steve Jobs means
I am undoubtedly you know Steve of Internet downtown fashion culture
period
by a long jump
I honestly feel that because Steve has passed you know it’s like when Biggie passed and Jay-Z was allowed to become Jay-Z
I’ve been connected to the most culturally important albums of the past four years the most influential artists of the past ten years
you have like Steve Jobs Walt Disney Henry Ford Howard Hughes Nicolas Ghesquière Anna Wintour David Stern
I think that’s a responsibility that I have to push possibilities to show people: this is the level that things could be at
so when you get something that has the name Kanye West on it it’s supposed to be pushing the furthest possibilities
I will be the leader of a company that ends up being worth billions of dollars because I got the answers
I understand culture
I am the nucleus
